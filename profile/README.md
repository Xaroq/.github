# Xaroq

**Xaroq** is an open-source, AI-powered web browser built with a focus on simplicity, transparency, and user control.

The project explores how AI can enhance everyday browsing — such as understanding pages, navigating content, and assisting users — without turning the browser into a black box or locking users into proprietary services.

### What Xaroq stands for
- **AI as a first-class feature**, not an add-on
- **Transparency** in how things work
- **Modular and open design**
- **User control and privacy by default**
- Built with **WebKitGTK** for a clean, lightweight foundation

Xaroq is developed openly and iteratively.  
Feedback, ideas, and contributions are welcome.
